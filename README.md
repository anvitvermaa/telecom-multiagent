Title: Multi-Agent Telecom Marketing & Support Optimizer
Objective: Orchestrate complex workflows for marketing message generation and verification plus web QA and support via stateful multi-agent graphs.

Key Features:
	•	Stateful orchestration using LangGraph: dynamic branching, reflection, supervisor-review loops, and auto-regeneration based on quality thresholds.
	•	Creative + Supervisor LLMs: LLaMA3 used for generating marketing messages and reviewing clarity/tone; scores drive iterative refinement.
	•	Web scraping & retrieval: Extracts promotional content, builds relevant example bases, and combines with RAG for context grounding.
	•	Evaluation & observability: Integrated with MLflow for autologging prompts, decisions, retrieval quality metrics, and answer correctness; supports Databricks model registry.
	•	Data integration: Customer features from MySQL (plan, usage, churn risk) influence messaging; outputs stored both in DB and structured JSON.

Tech Stack: LangGraph, LangChain, LLaMA3 (via Groq API), ChromaDB, sentence-transformers, MLflow, Databricks, Python ecosystem (pandas, SQLAlchemy, etc.).

Setup & Usage:
	1.	Install dependencies via provided automation script.
	2.	Configure LangGraph workflow with evaluation thresholds.
	3.	Feed customer/web data; pipeline generates, reviews, and logs marketing outputs, with retraining or regeneration triggered if quality metrics fall below thresholds.

Impact: Provides a reliable, evaluated, and improvable marketing intelligence pipeline that ties customer data to high-quality content generation with auditability.
